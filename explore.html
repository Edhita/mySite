            <h1>Howth</h1>
            <p> Howth is a nice fishing village located at the suburbs of Dublin. It has a beatifull sea views and it is a wealthy neigborhood. I recommend you to do the  6km long Cliff path loop, it is an enjoyable walking with stunning views and I found pretty easy the walking. There is plenty restaurants and my favorite restaurant is 'The House' for the best fish and chips.</p>

            <h1>Swords Stuary</h1>
            <p>This place is not very touristic, only local people knows about this place, if you are interested  about birds and want to get nice photos of swans, seagulls, etc. I recommend you to visit this place. The swans are very friendly, they can  get closer to you because they think you have bread for them. </p>
