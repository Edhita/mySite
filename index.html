           <h1>Famous Cliffs</h1>
           <p id="p1">My favorite city in Ireland is Galway, this city has something magic it is sorrounded by the sea and the birds I think that makes it special. The Cliffs of Moher is one of the best attractions in County Clare and it is worth it to visit it</p>
